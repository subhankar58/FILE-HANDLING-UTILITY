## DESCRIPTION ##
ðŸ“„ Java File Documentation: file01.java
1. Project Package
â€¢	package myjavaproject;
This statement declares that the class belongs to the myjavaproject package. Organizing classes into packages helps manage large projects and avoid name conflicts.

2. Imports
â€¢	import java.io.*;
â€¢	import java.util.*;
java.io.*: Imports all Input/Output classes like BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, FileWriter, IOException, etc.

java.util.*: Imports utility classes, including Scanner for user input.

3. Class Declaration
â€¢	public class file01
Defines a public class named file01. It contains methods to perform file operations like writing, reading, and modifying text files.

4. Methods
â€¢	 writeToFile(String filename, String content)
public static void writeToFile(String filename, String content)
Purpose: Writes the given content to the specified filename.

Operation:

Uses BufferedWriter with FileWriter to write content.

If the file exists, it overwrites it.

If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it creates a new one.

Error Handling: Catches IOException and prints the stack trace.

â€¢	readFromFile(String filename)
public static void readFromFile(String filename)
Purpose: Reads and prints the contents of the specified file line by line.

Operation:

Uses BufferedReader with FileReader.

Prints each line of the file to the console.

Error Handling: Catches and logs any read errors.

â€¢	 modifyFile(String filename, String target, String replacement)
public static void modifyFile(String filename, String target, String replacement)
Purpose: Searches the file for a specific target word and replaces all its occurrences with the replacement word.

Operation:

Reads the file content using BufferedReader.

Replaces words using String.replaceAll() and stores modified content in a StringBuilder.

Writes the updated content back to the same file using BufferedWriter.

Note: The entire file is read into memory before writing back.

Error Handling: Separate try-catch blocks handle read and write exceptions.

5. Main Method

public static void main(String[] args)
Purpose: Provides a basic console interface to:

Accept file name and content

Write to the file

Read the written content

Accept a word to replace and its replacement

Modify and re-read the updated file

âœ… Steps:
Prompt for file name and user input for content.

Call writeToFile() to save the content.

Display the file content via readFromFile().

Ask the user for a target word and a replacement word.

Call modifyFile() to perform search and replace.

Display the modified file again.

6. Program Output Sample
Enter filename: sample.txt
Enter content to write to the file: Java is fun. Java is powerful.
File written successfully.

Reading the file:
Java is fun. Java is powerful.

Enter word to replace: Java
Enter replacement word: Python
File modified successfully.

Reading the modified file:
Python is fun. Python is powerful.
7. Error Handling
Each file operation includes proper exception handling using try-catch.

If any I/O error occurs (e.g., file not found, permission denied), a message is shown and the error is printed using e.printStackTrace().

8. Enhancements You Can Add
Append mode in writing

Line-by-line modification option

Word count and search

GUI for file input/output

Use regex-based modifications

9. Conclusion
This class demonstrates basic file handling using Java I/O in a clean, modular way. Itâ€™s an excellent example for:

Beginners learning Java file handling

Simple applications needing file input/output

Demonstrating modification of text files
